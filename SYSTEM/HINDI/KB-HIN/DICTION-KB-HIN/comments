The shabd.txt dictionary has been "reversed" in order to 
obtain the first version of a morphological Hindi dictionary.

The following questions and comments have come to my mind:

1. The list of categories occurring in the Lex_Cat lines been converted into the
   listed category of the TULE envirronment 
   Adj		--> ADJ
   Adv		--> ADV
   Art		--> ART
   Comp		--> CONJ TYPE SUBORD (complementizer?)
   Interj	--> INTERJ
   N		--> NOUN
   Prep		--> PREP
   Pron		--> PRON TYPE PERS (personal pronoun)
   PossPron	--> PRON TYPE POSS (possessive pronoun)
   Refl Pron	--> PRON TYPE REFL-IMPERS (reflexive/impersonal pronoun)
                    (possibly the "impersonal" use is peculiar of Italian)
   Rel Pron	--> PRON TYPE REL (relative pronoun)
   V 		--> VERB
   VT 		--> VERB
   VI		--> VERB
   VTI 		--> VERB
   AuxV 	--> VERB TYPE AUX (auxiliaries)
   MV 		--> VERB TYPE MOD (modals)

     The following categories are more problematic
   Det		--> UNKNOWN (this includes numbers [eight, fifteen, ...], ordinals
                             [fourteenth, second, ...], indefinite adjectives
                             [some, several, ...]. Since there are just 61
                             occurrences, I will split by hand in the different
                             TULE categories: NUM, ADJ TYPE ORDIN, ADJ TYPE INDEF)
                             Possibly, indefinite pronouns should also be included
                             "Some of them will come")
        Note: It is not clear to me the difference of the four classes above. It could
              seem that the T and I tag keeps apart Transitives from Intransitives; 
              however, in the dictionary, we find:
              - abort (VI) "Peace talks had to be aborted" (transitive)
              - apply_3 (VI) "Apply the breaks wherever necessary (transitive)
              - approximate (VTI) "These statistics approximate the figures we have"
                     (I do not know an intransitive use of "approximate")
              Moreover, if the interpretation is correct, it is not clear what is the role
              of the V category.
   Interro	--> UNKNOWN (there are just two occurrences, i.e. "whose" and "why", but
                             not for "when", "where", etc.. I will cope with them by hand)
   Comb form	--> I skipped them (7 occurrences, they seem to be prefixes 
                    [aero, eco-, equi-, ...], but I do not handle them, and I do not
                    know if this applies just to English, or also to Hindi)
   Pref		--> Same as above. I didn't get the difference [ante, inter-, sub-, ...]
                    (21 lines)
   Suffix	--> Same as above for suffixes [-arian, ify, -wise, ...] (10 lines)
   IDM		--> Idioms ["affaire de coeur", "at first hand"] (208 entries). I
                    skipped them, since MultiWord expression are treated in a separate
                    dictionary. Also, it depends on the Hindi version, not English.
   Abbr		--> Abbreviations. The same as for idioms. (74 entries)
   Part		--> I do not know! Just two instances: "around", "apart". Skipped.
   PhrV		--> Phrasal verbs? These are compound verbs, including an adverb
                    (blow_up, carry_away, ...). There are 337 entries. Again, they
                    are represented in a different way in TULE, and the tag applies
                    to English, not necessarily to Hindi, so I skipped them
   PhrVT	--> Transitive Phrasal verbs? Applied just to compounds of "keep"
                    [keep_at, keep_away, ...]. Skipped
   PhrVI	--> Same as above (intransitive readings of keep_at, ...?). Skipped
   PropN	--> 1 occurrence for Santa Claus. Skipped
   VP		--> These seem again phrasal verbs [tuck_into, tumble_down]. 5 entries. Skipped

   There is also an occurrence of category "Pron." [umpteen] that I changed to "Pron"

2. QUESTION-1: What does the slash stand for? (e.g. "aBAgA/becArA" (poor), "aBAva/kamI" (scarcity))

3. QUESTION-2: What does the curled brackets stand for? (e.g. "AhlAxa{ucca}", Akqwi{reKAciwra}, 
               apoDZa{deposit}, ...)

4. QUESTION-3: Same for standard brackets (e.g. "awisAmAnya[Sabxa]", "Awmika[BAvanA]", 
               "baDZAnA[baDZanA]", ...)

5. QUESTION-4: Same for colon (e.g. "aMwa:saMcAra", "anwa:sWApana", "xu:Kaxa", ...)

6. QUESTION-5: There are just three entries including a mid-accent ("avEXa`vyApAra", "mannawa`kA",
                "wucCa`karanA"). Is this correct? Since it may cause some problems to my
                tokenizer (the procedure that splits the text into words).

7. QUESTION-6: Is the question mark correct in "hameSA?", "pawanakAraka?"

8. QUESTION-7: Is the tilde (?) correct in "viSeRa~vyavasWA"?

9. QUESTION-8: Is the final "2" correct in "yojanA2"?

10. QUESTION-9: Is the period correct in "parxA{ba.}", "Puta{ba.}", "sUara{pu.}", "usa{pu.}",
               "vetara{swrI.}", "wAlukaxAra{swrI.}" (note that we also have "vaha{swrI}",
               without period)

11. For reasons similar to the ones in 6 above (tokenizer), I've moved "ki.gra", "ki.hartaj",
   "ki.mI", "vI.sI.Ara" in a different dictionary

12. I have removed from the dictionary all Hindi MultiWords that, I assume, are identified
   by an underscore. Of course, this is a strong simplification, but, as I noted above
   for the IDM, idioms are treated differently. They should be used to generate a
   separate dictionary file. But this is another work.

13. There are some (presumed) errors in the entries for "breech", "rule", "tick",
   "freely", "solemnize", "Urdu", "urea", "yellow_card", "yellow_line", whose Hindi meaning
   is given as "1", "3", "^" or "-". I removed them.
   Also, two entries for "hip" are translated in Hindi with a numerical prefix, which I removed.

14. I also removed the entry for "'V'Akqwi", which is rather strange, since it is stated that
   it corresponds to the English verb "V"

15. All numbers (including ordinals) have been removed from the dictionary. They will
   be handled separately.

16. There are 133 English words without translation. Not a problem.

17. The Hindi translation for "cross" (AdZA/wiraCA/2.cidZacidZA/haTI/3.prawikUla) seems to
   correspond to three different entries. I changed it into three separate meanings.

18. Same as above for "KulA/2.prawyakRa/prakata" (overt)

19. Same as above for "varcasva/praXAnawA/2.SAsana" (domination)

20. Same as above for "XuMXalA/kAlA/2.uxAsa/malina" (dusky)

21. I removed the final exclamation mark from "ahAz!", "hAya!"
