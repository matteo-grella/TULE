; *** this converts the meaning of prepositions in terms of ontology concepts
;     each description has the following form:
;        (prep-meaning CONC-LIST)
;     each CONC-LIST is either the value "unambiguous" (in which case the meaning
;     of the preposition is prep-meaning itself), or:
;        (SELECTOR concepts)
;     where a SELECTOR is a pair <upper-concept lower-concept> and "concepts" is
;        a list of possible ontology concepts corresponding to the preposition
; *** EXAMPLE:
;       (--di-relation (
;	   ((££concert ££person) (££conduct)) 		; concerto di Abbado
;        ))
;     Is to be read as:
;       if the preposition meaning is --di-relation
;          if the governing concept is a subconcept of ££concert and
;             the governed concept is a subconcept of ££person
;          then the ontology concept corresponding to "di" is ££conduct
