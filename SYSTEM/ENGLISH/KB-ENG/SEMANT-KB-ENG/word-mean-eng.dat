; **** meanings (expressed as references to the ontology) for English words.
;      They include English proper names and afc object names

; **** the structure of word meaning info is as follows.
   ;     1- (biglietto ££ticket)			; standard non-ambiguous meaning
   ;     2- (what (adj --q-art) (pron ££simple-event))  ; category-controlled ambiguity
   ;     3- (dirigere ((££conduct ££direct-movie)))     ; Uncontrolled ambiguity
   ;     4- (number ££number phone ££phone-number)      ; Dep-modified meaning
; *** The last case applies, for instance to "telephone number"; though, in
;     principle, it is compositional, it should be resolved as a reference to
;     the concept ££phone-number. This may be implementation-dependent, since
;     it is necessary to have the goal-concept of a query "give me the phone
;     number of ...", which cannot be "number", because it's too general. But
;     the phenomenon must be handled anyway in order to account for non-
;     restrictive modifiers as "toy gun", which is not a gun.
; *** Note that this could be applied also to verb particles (as "take away")
;     but currently a different mechanism is used, i.e. the interpreter builds
;     the lemma "take_away" by concatenating the verb and the particle
