; *** the preference data have the following structure:
;     (PREP (NOUNUP NOUNDOWN)))
;     this has to be read as follows:
;     in case the linking preposition is PREP, then
;     the attach of NOUNDOWN to NOUNUP is specially strong,
;     (a pseudo-locution), so that any modifier of NOUNDOWN
;     should rather be attached to NOUNUP
; *** see examples for Italian
